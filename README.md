# Boilerplate Multi-Tenant web app: Role Based Permissions, Passport local authentication, React, Node.js, Bootstrap, Webpack

Multi-Tenant boiler plate website. Supports multiple client setup, multiple client branding.  Each tenant/client site contains it's own set of users (role: 'User') and admins (role: 'Admin').

### Post Setup

There are three built in roles:
'User' (default), 'Admin' and 'SiteAdmin'

Only the Admin and SiteAdmin can access the User administration tool. The SiteAdmin can edit the users, the Admin role can only view the user list.

To add a SiteAdmin, create a new user account from the /signup page. Then manually update the database, set that user role to 'SiteAdmin'

##### User Admin view. Server-side paging, sortable, search by text filtering.

#### Setting up Client Sites
Client setup files are located in src/client-branding. There are three simple examples:
src/client-branding
	+ company123/
	+ companyabc/
	+ companyxyz/

To add a new client, add a new directory with corresponding index.html and site-branding.scss files

Each client branding directory can be served up by adding /etc/hosts rules to serve up the client directories as subdomains.

Example /etc/hosts setup (for local dev):
```
127.0.0.1 mutlitenant.com
127.0.0.1 CompanyABC.mutlitenant.com
127.0.0.1 CompanyXYZ.mutlitenant.com
127.0.0.1 Company123.mutlitenant.com
```

Client sites must be added to the database using the Company Administration tool when logged in as a SiteAdmin.
